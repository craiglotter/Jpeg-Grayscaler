Jpeg-Grayscaler
===============

Jpeg Grayscaler tries to convert any image files passed to it into maximum quality grayscale jpeg images. Input files are added by drag-and-dropping files on the listbox control. The resulting jpg files are saved in the same location as the source files.  Created by Craig Lotter, November 2006
